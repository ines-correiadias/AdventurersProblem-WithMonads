# Modelling-Analysis-CyberPhysicalSystem-WithMonads
Group project developed for the Cyber-Physical Computation course, together with my colleague Jo√£o Pedro Gomes (JoaoPedro9400 on Github). Consisted in modelling and analysing a cyber-physical system, using monads in Haskell.
Adventurers.hs: main file of the project, which results from completing the code in file StartingPoint_Adventurers.hs;
StartingPoint_Adventurers.hs: file provided by the Professor of the course, which served as a starting point for developing Adventurers.hs.
DurationMonad.hs: file provided by the Professor of the course, which contains an auxiliar module to Adventurers.hs.
